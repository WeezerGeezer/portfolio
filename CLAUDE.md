# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a static personal portfolio website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site showcases Mitchell Carter's profile, projects, experience, and contact information.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file containing all page sections (profile, about, projects, experience, contact)
- `style.css` - Primary stylesheet with desktop styles
- `mediaqueries.css` - Responsive design styles for mobile/tablet devices
- `script.js` - JavaScript for hamburger menu toggle functionality
- `assets/` - Contains all images, icons, and resume PDF
- `photo-portfolio/` - Empty directory for potential future photo portfolio content

## Development

This is a static website with no build process or dependencies. Changes can be made directly to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### Testing Changes
- Open `index.html` directly in a browser to view changes
- Test responsive design by resizing the browser window or using browser dev tools
- Verify hamburger menu functionality on mobile viewport sizes

### Key Components
- Responsive navigation (desktop nav and hamburger menu for mobile)
- Profile section with hero image and call-to-action buttons
- About section with profile image and skills/experience details
- Projects section showcasing portfolio items with GitHub/Live Demo links
- Experience section with work history
- Contact section with social media links

### File Management
- All assets should be placed in the `assets/` directory
- Profile and project images should be optimized for web use
- Resume PDF should be updated in `assets/resume.pdf` when needed
